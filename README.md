# A simple Web Application that showcases the use of an ASP.NET API to read/write JSON files using the Newtonsoft package.

On 09/02/2022 we had a PALS session on JSON in relation to COMP1004. A link to the recording of this session can be found below.

As per the project brief, your SPA is intended to have functionality that can read/write JSON files. The method that I have shown you (the one in this repository) may seem complicated, but if you can follow along with my code and understand it then your project will be meeting all expectations of the module. 

Also, having a little insight into API's will slightly help you next year in your **COMP2001 Information Management & Retrieval** module.

You should find that most code within this repository has been commented. However, trying to understand the code through only the comments may be difficult and therefore you might want to refer to the Podcast video (linked at the bottom). 

**IMPORTANT:** The code I have written may not fully suit your needs and this is intended - please use this as a basis and expand upon it so that it better suits your own COMP1004 project!


## Video Explanations
Please note that the code shown in the original PALS session may be slightly out-of-date.
